DESCRIPTION
* Minimalist, so as few distractions and as little bloat as possible within Visual Studio .NET Core 5 C#'s constraints
* Extensive quality documentation
* Full transparency of the software and all the formats it uses
* Dedication to Public Domain to encourage derivatives of the said software
* Maybe also as a [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) repository. Perhaps for a limited time or not, not quite so sure about that.
